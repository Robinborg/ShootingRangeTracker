# ShootingRangeTracker
Tracks the performance on the range

This is for a track of 1-5 people and 5 rounds per 5 shooting positions.
The initial score is 75, each hit is 0, each miss is -3, hit on the second bullet will be -1 and finally an option to change the previous input, if it was wrong.(E.g. changing a miss to a hit on the second bullet)

I am building a list for the players.
The main body will be a while loop which will iterate 5 times 5 and break when rounds is complete.
The score will be shown in the end with a performance graph and have the possibilty to send those scores&graphs to the participants email.
